# Paripakv

Paripakv is an Indian Non-Profit(NGO) focused on education. As my contribution to help further this cause I volunteered to create and mentain their website. The website is coded in HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript for animations. I would love to hear about an issues or feedback on the website through pull requests.
