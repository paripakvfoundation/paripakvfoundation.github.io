                <p>Samajh is an endeavour to augment
                    the quality and capacity of these
                    local initiatives by providing
                    dedicated teachers with quality
                    training and mentoring in core
                    subjects to such schools at the
                    middle school level in a partnership
                    model.
                    Our teachers comprise of young
                    adults who are passionate and
                    willing to be molded into good
                    teachers. These teachers need to
                    demonstrate a social commitment
                    besides being experts in their subject
                    areas. The teachers are subjected to
                    continuous mentoring by an expert
                    panel of advisors comprising
                    experienced teachers, professionals
                    & educators. This combination brings
                    together the technology competence
                    of the youth with the traditional
                    education experience of the mentors
                    to create a unique program targeted
                    towards Samajh (understanding) as
                    against rote exam-focussed learning.</p>

                    sponsors the specialised coaching

                    mentoring him/her. We aim to
